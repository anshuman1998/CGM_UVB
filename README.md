# The file colden_Z1.005_Q14.txt has the column densities of 20 ions at Z=1.005 for Q14 of KS18, for log(hydrogen densities) ranging from -2 to -5. 
# The horizontal lines obtained as a result of the code z1.005_Q14.py when run on plotly, are the column densities obtained when Z=0.1, and log(hydrogen density) is -4, for Q14. This is the "observed" value.
# The curves are for log(column density) of a particular ion versus log(hydrogen density).
# The dark grey region is the +- sigma region of the mean hydrogen density for the 20 ions where it matches with the observed value.
# The light grey region is the +- 2 * sigma region.
# It is observed that CIII, NIII, and OIII do not have a log(hydrogen density) value lying even inside the 2 * sigma region.(Referred to as missing ions) The rest 17 ions have log(nH) values inside the 2 * sigma region. 
# On taking the best possible combination of less standard deviation of log(nH), and least number of missing ions, Z = 1.005 was decided upon.
