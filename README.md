# CGM_UVB

# prog18.py creates a set of test observations using Q18
# and has Z = 0.1 (log scale), hydrogen density = -4 (log scale)
# stopping column density = 10^14 and a redshift of 0.2

# n_H_and_Z_solfinder.py runs an iterative program over a specified range
# of metallicity and hydrogen density for a particular quasar source.
# It lists all possible solution pairs (n_H,Z) for each metal
# In 20 files for 20 metals.
# It also plots these solutions on n_H vs Z space.
